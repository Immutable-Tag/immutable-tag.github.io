## Future Work

With considerations to time constraints, our team decided to test our project idea of tag immutability using blockchains by employing Ethereum Blockchains, which a permissionless blockchain. Ideally, the use of of permissioned blockchains would provided more stability to the tag immutability. Hence, in the future we aim to develop this idea using a permissioned blockchain, more specifically, the ResilientDB blockchain. To know more about ResilientDB, you can refer to the following the Github repository or the website:
