## Our solution

<!-- Explain our solution, how our project helps solve the problem and what is unique about it, including some technical detail. -->

Our solution uses the tamper-evident and tamper-resistant nature of blockchain to guarantee tag immutability and provide assurance to users that their products will continue functioning with the same level of reliability.

Since most VCS support the concept of tags, they can make use of our tool-agnostic solution to support tag immutability in their products. Source-code repository hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and SourceForge can also provide their users with tag immutability and since these host most of the worldâ€™s open-source projects, the benefit can be extended to millions of developers and end-users worldwide.

We have exposed RESTful APIs so that these third-party applications can easily use our solution.
