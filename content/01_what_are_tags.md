## What are tags?

Version Control Systems (VCS) provide the functionality to tag specific points in a repositoryâ€™s history as milestones which can be used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag can be considered as a branch which should not change after being created and mapped to a commit.

<p align="center">
    <i>Tags point to commits</i>
</p>
